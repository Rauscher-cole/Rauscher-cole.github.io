title: "Data Science Projects"

Here you’ll find a curated collection of the projects I’ve worked on — from predictive modeling and marketing analytics to interactive dashboards and machine learning workflows. 

I’m passionate about using data to uncover patterns, drive smarter decisions, and tell compelling stories. Whether it’s building classification models for NCAA predictions, analyzing consumer behavior, or mapping crime trends, I enjoy blending technical skill with creative problem-solving. 

These projects reflect not just what I’ve learned, but how I think — with curiosity, clarity, and a drive to build things that are both insightful and actionable.
